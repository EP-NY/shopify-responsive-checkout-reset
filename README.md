# Shopify Responsive Checkout Reset
=================================

This is a full reset for Shopify Responsive Checkout (http://www.shopify.com/blog/15714308-introducing-responsive-checkout) released in October, 2014. I recommend that it is used in tandem with Reset.css by Eric Meyer (http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/). Feel free to fork + PR if there is something I haven't covered.

This is very much a work in progress!
